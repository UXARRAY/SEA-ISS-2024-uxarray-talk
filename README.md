**Abstract**: UXarray is an Open-Source Python package that provides standard data analysis and visualization functionality for Unstructured Grids. Development of the package is through a collaboration between Project Raijin (NCAR and Pennsylvania State University) and the SEATS Project (Argonne National Laboratory, UC Davis, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory). UXarray aims to provide a familiar and comfortable experience for users that have used the extremely popular Xarray package. Discussed will be many of the important design choices that were made in ensuring a familiar user experience, including the use of inheritance with Xarray’s core data structures, and other techniques. Additionally, a discussion on UXarray’s use of Github maintaining a community-owned project will be discussed, including the use of Issues, Pull Requests, Discussions, & Project Boards
